# Synthanoid
Synthanoid is my first complete game built in Unity. It's only a simple block-breaking game but as a beginner programmer it represents an early milestone in my career as a developer.

A playable build of the game is hosted over at [SIMMER.IO](https://simmer.io/@danlechambre/synthanoid).
